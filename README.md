# g-chat-enhancer - Google Chat Enhancer [PROJECT ABANDONED]

Google Chat Enhancer is a set of tools to make Google (Hangouts) Chat web version better.

Google Chat lacks a lot of needed functionallity, such as "Reply" button, message read status, custom sounds, dark theme, and so on.

This repository brings all of the JS-based custom functions all together in order to fullfill missing feautures.
